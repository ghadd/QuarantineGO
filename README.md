### Lection #0 Intro to course // 12.04.2020

It was said about the overall course aim and its rules e.g

* discipline
* programming inevitability in todays world
* prerequisities for course
* grading system
* some others...

### Lection #1 Intro to Go Syntax // 14.04.2020

Falshstart xD from making an X-MAS tree in console. Basically, for me this was truly easy as I'm down to programming quite a long time and I had a python script, which did the same, moreover it was blinking with different colors. So, basically

* WORKSPACE ==> really positive about such kind of a structure. Reminds me some Java Maven project one.
* Variables declarations
* loops
* conditionals
* (fmt => stands for `formatted` and is used for standart input and output)

### Lection #2 Variables and Strings // 16.04.2020

It was a good discussion and overlook of basic golang variables syntax and strings usage (especially with runes and stuff). Main points

* variables
* constants
* inline declarations
* underscore syntax
* ABSENCE OF CHARS --> ps. they are somthing as tight dependence bytes (which is int8 alias for ASCII stuff) and runes (an alias for int32 to represent the whole Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) literals)
* if-else statements
* switch statement
* for loop with multiple declarations in it

*We are getting ready to GO!*

### Lection #3 Q&A // 18.04.2020

The Q&A session started on summing up the week and overall situation among the students.

1. 
> Q. "When is it ok to attend to be hired by IT companies?" 

> A. "ASAP. Really. You gotta have to try attending to the companies (no matter what level of this company is -> start from the small and go higher). From the time when you started studying in the uni and you feel that you have some potential - just go ahead."

2. 
> Q. "What language it's better to choose when you start learing programming stuff?"

> A. "You gotta choose really unpopular language. That will help you not to concentrate the "only wanted" language, but to understand the programming origin."

3. 
> Q. "Do I have to try harder myself or ask someone for help?"

> A. "Definitely DO NOT stop on something on a long period. Try asking people who may know the solution or just skip the problem for a while. The solution is going to come to your mind suddenly."

4. 
> Q. "Do I have to know OOP?"

> A. "Sounds like self-answering question. Certainly you have to. This is the kind of basics every programmer must know no matter if you are using functional languages. Moders problems require modern solutions!"

5. 
> Q. "What university it's better to graduate from?"

> A. "The university doesn't really matter. What matters - is the place it is located. It's better to choose the city, which has a bunch of IT companies located in. That's gotta work out."

### Lection #4 Writing simple algorithms // 21.04.2020

Along the lection, it was discussed how to dive into codind something. Especially for bigger projects, splitting data into pieces and KISS-rule* insructions is really important to prevent messing up whilst coding. It was written a small program to solve the quadratic equation. The cool thing is GO's acceptance of complex numbers in its native package cmplx.

*KISS-rule stands for "Keep is simple, stupid" - the key rule of objectivism.

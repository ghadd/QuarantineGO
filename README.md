### Lection #0 Intro to course // 12.04.2020

It was said about the overall course aim and its rules e.g

* discipline
* programming inevitability in todays world
* prerequisities for course
* grading system
* some others...

### Lection #1 Intro to Go Syntax // 14.04.2020

Falshstart xD from making an X-MAS tree in console. Basically, for me this was truly easy as I'm down to programming quite a long time and I had a python script, which did the same, moreover it was blinking with different colors. So, basically

* WORKSPACE ==> really positive about such kind of a structure. Reminds me some Java Maven project one.
* Variables declarations
* loops
* conditionals
* (fmt => stands for `formatted` and is used for standart input and output)

### Lection #2 Variables and Strings // 16.04.2020

It was a good discussion and overlook of basic golang variables syntax and strings usage (especially with runes and stuff). Main points

* variables
* constants
* inline declarations
* underscore syntax
* ABSENCE OF CHARS --> ps. they are somthing as tight dependence bytes (which is int8 alias for ASCII stuff) and runes (an alias for int32 to represent the whole Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) literals)
* if-else statements
* switch statement
* for loop with multiple declarations in it

*We are getting ready to GO!*
